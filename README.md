# leaflet-antarctica-demo-for-r
Demo of an Antarctic map built with Leaflet for R, using EPSG:3031. 

A single R file using [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to achieve a map similar to my web-based Antarctic map at <https://thomasswilliams.github.io/leaflet-antarctic-demo/>.

See blog post at <https://thomasswilliams.github.io/development/2022/06/18/leaflet-and-r.html> for more info.
